                <h3>> Bio</h3>
            </header>
            <p>I was born in sunny Orlando, FL on September 28th, 1990. I moved to Georgia when I was 6, just after the 1996 Summer Olympics. I grew up in Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta. As a youngster, I played the saxophone, loved video games, and enjoyed the occasional D&D campaign. For college I attended Georgia Tech, where I graduated with a degree in Industrial Engineering. After school I lived in Brooklyn for a brief time, before coming back to Atlana and starting a career in Tech.</p>

                <h3>> Work</h3>
            </header>
            <p>My first job out of college was as an IT Consultant, working on various windows-based projects. I grew bored with that, and moved jobs to be a QA tester at eVestment, a FinTech company in Atlanta. While there I grew a passion for Product Management, and I eventually moved over to a Product Owner role at that company. After eVestment I went to Big Nerd Ranch to enjoy agency life for about a year. I then was offered a Product Manager job at a startup called MemberSuite. That job lasted about 4 months before there was a large round of layoffs. I then landed at OneTrust, in the same Product Manager role. That job made me realize that I now longer want to be a PM, so I quit and joined DigitalCrafts, and here we are.</p>

            <h4>>> Music</h4>
            <p>Growing up, my dad gave me a great appreciation for music. He played the Blues for as long as I can remember, and I would go watch him play in downtown Orlando even as an infant. In school I learned to play saxophone, and was a huge band nerd.</p>
            <p>Today I am big into hip-hop, and still some metal from my more angsty days. I have been collecting records for about a decade now, and I rarely miss the chance to see my favorite artists perform when they come through town.</p>
            <h4>>> Basketball</h4>
            <p>My love for basketball started in 2008, when Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett announced that they would form a 'Big 3' by joining Paul Pierece and the Boston Celtics. The sports world was incredibly excited for this new grouping, and I, as a novice basketball fan, was immediately intrigued.</p>
            <p>I followed the Celtics that whole year, until they played my hometown Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. The Hawks finished that year at 37-45, just good enough for the 8th seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs they were heavy underdogs against the heavily favored Celtics, who would go on to win the championship that year. The series ended up being incredibly competitive, with the climax coming when an emotional Zaza Pachulia, backup Hawks center from Georgia, the country, emphatically cried <strong>"NOTHING EASY"</strong> after the Hawks finished game 6 with a W. From that point on I was hooked.</p>
            <p>Now I'm a diehard Atlanta Hawks fan. I know, there aren't many of us, and the recent years have been a little tough. But now we have this plucky kid from Oklahoma named Trae, and these next few years are going to be incredibly exciting. Go Hawks!</p>
            <h4>>> Pepper & Tucker</h4>
            <p>Lastly, the two loves of my life, my wonderful dogs Pepper and Tucker:</p>
            <p>Pepper has been with me for about 6 years - she is a Dachshund/Corgi mix and is around 8 years old. She is the sweetest dog I've ever had, and expecially loves to nestle in between couch cushions and beg for belly rubs. Her hair is a fiery orange, with waves that would rival Farrah Faucets. Her leg hair makes it look like she is wearing shorts.</p>
            <p>I've had Tucker for around 2 years. I adopted him from a friend, who had just had a baby and didn't have the time to take care of him. Funny enough, his name is also my middle name - I chose to keep his name as he was about 6 years old when I adopted him. Tucker is a small lab mix at around 35 pounds, and is very intelligent and energetic. His favorite things are chasing birds and laying his chin on my lap. His fur is short and orange/brown.</p>
